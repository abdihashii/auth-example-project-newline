## Introduction

In this project, we explore the powerful features of Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative, and integrate it with a Next.js and RSC application. Supabase provides a complete authentication and authorization solution, allowing you to easily manage user authentication and access control in your application.

## Features

- User registration and login using Supabase authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) using Supabase authorization
- Securely storing user data and credentials in Supabase database
- Seamless integration with Next.js and RSC for server-side rendering and improved performance

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/abdihashii/auth-example-project-newline.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure Supabase: Create a Supabase project and obtain your API keys. Update the `.env` file with your Supabase project URL and API keys. (See .env.example for configuration)
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The application provides a user-friendly interface for user registration, login, and accessing protected routes based on user roles.
